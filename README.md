# Hello, I'm Evgeniy Efimov 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

- 🌐 Currently located in Slovenia.

- 🐍 Skilled in Python, Selenium, PyTest, and various testing tools.
- 📚 I also have a background as an Information Technology Professor.

## My Projects

Here are some of the projects you can find in my repositories:

- [Current Project](https://github.com/eeefimov/FreenanceProject.git) - A small web app to control your finances.
- [Diploma Project](https://github.com/eeefimov/Rostelecom.git) - It may not be the best project, but I made it. I applied testing techniques and principles and continue to improve my automation testing skills.
- [API Project During Education](https://github.com/eeefimov/PetFriends_API_tests.git) - It's quite basic. I now apply my knowledge of API in the current project. There are currently issues with Swagger, but more tests are coming soon.
